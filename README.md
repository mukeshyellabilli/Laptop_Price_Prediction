# Laptop Price Prediction System

## Introduction
The *Laptop Price Prediction System* is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the price of laptops based on their specifications. With the increasing number of options available in the market, it can be challenging for consumers to understand the price range of laptops based on different features. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the price of a laptop given its specifications such as processor, RAM, storage, display size, and more. The goal is to help consumers make informed decisions and manufacturers optimize pricing strategies.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- *data/*: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- *notebooks/*: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- *src/*: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
- *models/*: Stores the trained machine learning models.
- *README.md*: Documentation file with project details.
- *requirements.txt*: Lists the Python libraries required to run the project.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

Install all dependencies using the following command:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- *Brand*: The brand name of the laptop (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo).
- *Model*: The specific model name or number.
- *Processor*: The type of processor used in the laptop (e.g., Intel i5, AMD Ryzen 5).
- *RAM*: The amount of RAM (in GB).
- *Storage*: The type and amount of storage (e.g., 512GB SSD, 1TB HDD).
- *Display Size*: The size of the laptop display (in inches).
- *Screen Resolution*: The resolution of the screen (e.g., 1920x1080).
- *Graphics Card*: Type of graphics card (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1650).
- *Operating System*: The operating system installed (e.g., Windows 10, macOS).
- *Battery Life*: Average battery life (in hours).
- *Weight*: Weight of the laptop (in kg).
- *Price*: The target variable representing the price of the laptop.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes the following preprocessing steps:

1. *Handling Missing Values*: Missing values are imputed or removed to ensure data quality.
2. *Feature Encoding*: Categorical variables such as Brand and Processor are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
3. *Feature Scaling*: Numerical features such as RAM and Storage are scaled to ensure consistency in the data.
4. *Feature Engineering*: New features are created to improve model performance, such as calculating the Price per GB of storage.

## Model Training
The following machine learning models are used for predicting laptop prices:

- *Linear Regression*: A simple regression model to predict price based on a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
- *Decision Tree Regressor*: A model that splits the data into branches based on feature values to predict prices.
- *Random Forest Regressor*: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
- *Gradient Boosting Regressor*: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to minimize prediction errors.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*: The average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices.
- *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*: The average squared difference between predicted and actual prices.
- *Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*: The square root of the average squared difference, providing an error measure in the same units as the target variable.
- *R-squared*: The proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the features.

## How to Use
1. *Clone the Repository*:
    bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    
2. *Navigate to the Project Directory*:
    bash
    cd laptop-price-prediction
    
3. *Run the Jupyter Notebook*:
    Open notebooks/Laptop_Price_Prediction.ipynb to view the step-by-step implementation or use the Python scripts in the src/ directory for standalone predictions.

4. *Predict Laptop Price*:
    Use the src/predict.py script to input laptop specifications and get a price prediction:
    bash
    python src/predict.py --brand Dell --model XPS13 --processor "Intel i7" --ram 16 --storage "512GB SSD" --display_size 13.3 --resolution "1920x1080" --graphics "Intel Iris Plus" --os "Windows 10" --battery_life 10 --weight 1.2
    

## Results
The models provide the following results on the test dataset:

- *Linear Regression*: R-squared of 0.85 with an RMSE of $150.
- *Decision Tree Regressor*: R-squared of 0.78 with an RMSE of $200.
- *Random Forest Regressor*: R-squared of 0.90 with an RMSE of $120.
- *Gradient Boosting Regressor*: R-squared of 0.92 with an RMSE of $110.

These results indicate that the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models provide the most accurate predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- *Incorporate More Features*: Include additional features such as user reviews and brand reputation to improve prediction accuracy.
- *Web Interface*: Develop a web-based application to make it easier for users to input laptop specifications and receive price predictions.
- *Model Optimization*: Experiment with hyperparameter tuning and other advanced algorithms to further improve model performance.
